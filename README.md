✅ Within the 35-44 years age group, Kitkat shows the highest average rank indicating it is the most popular among adults in this age range.

✅ Among the elderly aged 65+, Dairy Milk achieves the highest average rank, suggesting it is the most popular choice for this age group.

It's notable that four out of the top five most frequently ranked brands are from Cadbury, suggesting a strong representation of this manufacturer within the dataset. KitKat from Nestle also features prominently in the top 5.
