## Insights

To determine the most popular chocolate bar brand within each specified age group, I analyzed the average rank achieved by each brand within that group, where a higher average rank indicates higher popularity.

Based on my analysis of the dataset:

✅ For the 18-24 years age group, Crunchie has the highest average rank making it the most popular brand among this demographic.

✅ Within the 35-44 years age group, Kitkat shows the highest average rank indicating it is the most popular among adults in this age range.

✅ Among the elderly aged 65+, Dairy Milk achieves the highest average rank, suggesting it is the most popular choice for this age group.


Based on the analysis of the dataset, the top 5 most frequently ranked chocolate bar brands overall are:

✅ Twirl (Cadbury) with 28% of total rank along across dataset

✅ KitKat (Nestle)with 23% of total rank along across dataset

✅ Dairy Milk (Cadbury) with 18% of total rank along across dataset

✅ Crunchie (Cadbury) with 16% of total rank along across dataset

✅ Double Decker (Cadbury) with 15% of total rank along across dataset

It's notable that four out of the top five most frequently ranked brands are from Cadbury, suggesting a strong representation of this manufacturer within the dataset. KitKat from Nestle also features prominently in the top 5.























The analysis shows that Twirl, Crunchie, Dairy Milk, and Double Decker from Cadbury are the top 4 in that order, while KitKat from Nestle is the 5th. The least ranked are Picnic, Mars, Boost, Bounty and Galaxy. The age group 18-24 love Crunchie; followed by Twirl, 35-44 love Kitkat; followed by Twirl, while 65+ love Dairy Milk; followed by Twirl.
